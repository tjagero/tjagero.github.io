**Description:**  
In this hands-on project, I acted as a Cloud Security Engineer for a fictional startup, Mama Bear Catering & Pastry. My role involved setting up IAM users and enforcing the principle of least privilege using permissions boundaries in AWS.

**Objective:**  
Ensure system administrators had the appropriate level of access based on their roles, and restrict any unnecessary permissions to reduce security risks.

**Steps Taken:**
- Created three system administrator IAM users (`sysadmin-1`, `sysadmin-2`, and `sysadmin-3`)
- Created a `Sysadmins` IAM group with an AdministratorAccess policy
- Assigned EC2 permissions boundary to `sysadmin-2` and S3 permissions boundary to `sysadmin-3`
- Verified that users could only access services they were permitted to (e.g., `sysadmin-3` could not launch EC2 instances)

**Technologies Used:**  
`AWS IAM`, `IAM Permissions Boundaries`, `EC2`, `S3`, `AWS Console`, `Least Privilege Principle`

**Key Achievements:**  
- Demonstrated a practical use of IAM boundaries to enforce least privilege
- Successfully limited administrator capabilities by service
- Ensured security while maintaining role-based flexibility
